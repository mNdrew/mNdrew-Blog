👋 Hi! Welcome to the mNdrew ~~Devlog~~ Blog. 


# 🌱 Why Change?
The previous version of my [Blog](https://mndrewdevlog.web.app/blog/) does not really allow me to write using Obsidian (my main note taking application). This increases the friction to write and update posts hence the [[General/Transition to Quartz\|transition to Quartz]]. 

Quartz allows me to utilize Obsidian in such a way that once the setup is complete. I just need to write, review, and publish my notes as posts. Albeit with the caveat that I need access to my Computer (at least for now 😉).
