I've always been fascinated by mountains. How these land formations take could take millions of years to form. For the longest time I just look at them when traveling to the province and always wonder when I start and thankfully one of my friends invited me to Sagada, Mountain Province where we went up [[Life Updates/Hike-Home#Marlboro Hill]].

*Sadly, I was not able to record the whole hike as my batteries died right after passing the peak. Lesson learned to always charge up and pack a lightweight power bank (also to take time to prioritize self as I was lending charging ports the night before 😆) .* See my friend, Donn's [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/14035242381) for the whole trek.
