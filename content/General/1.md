# ðŸŒ± Why Change?
The previous version of my [Blog](https://mndrewdevlog.web.app/blog/) does not really allow me to write using Obsidian (my main note taking application). This increases the friction to write and update posts. 


# ðŸ’» The Stack
- **Obsidian**
	- For writing content.
- **Quartz**
	- Generating and managing blog posts.
- **GitHub**
	- Version Control and Deployment Automation
> [!NOTE] GitHub Changes
> Due to the recent changes in [GitHub](https://www.theverge.com/news/757461/microsoft-github-thomas-dohmke-resignation-coreai-team-transition), I might transition to a different Version Control System (VCS) soon. 
- **Vercel**
	- Hosting deployment

> [!NOTE] Exploring other options
> For redundancy I also am planning to deploy in other hosting platforms such as Cloudflare and Firebase
