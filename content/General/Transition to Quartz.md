# ðŸŒ± Why Change?
The previous version of my [Blog](https://mndrewdevlog.web.app/blog/) does not really allow me to write using Obsidian (my main note taking application). This increases the friction to write and update posts. 


# ðŸ’» The Stack and workflow
- **Obsidian**
	- For writing and organizing content.
- **Quartz**
	- Static-site Generator from Obsidian.md Files
- **GitHub**
	- Version Control and Deployment Automation
	 > Due to the recent changes in [GitHub](https://www.theverge.com/news/757461/microsoft-github-thomas-dohmke-resignation-coreai-team-transition), I might transition to a different Version Control System (VCS) soon. 
- **Vercel**
	- Hosting Provider
> 	For redundancy I also am planning to deploy in other hosting platforms such as Cloudflare, Firebase or even GitHub Pages.
